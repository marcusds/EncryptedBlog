== Description ==
Encrypts WordPress blog posts and pages so that even with access to the WordPress database your posts will still be private and secure.
This plugin is in ALPHA! Be incredibly careful in your use of it.
If you want to try this plugin out best to do so on a new install for now, works nicely then at least.
For maximum security and the only way you will know 100% your data is safe in transmission is if you use HTTPS as well.

== Installation ==
Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

As of now there is no way to unencrypt articles that have been encrypted. This will be added in a later version.
